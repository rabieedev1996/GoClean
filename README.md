This project is a template with a Clean Architecture, written in the Go programming language, designed to provide the foundational capabilities for developing software. My goal with this project is to implement a comprehensive set of essential features required for a backend project. This project includes the following:

<ul>
<li>Infrastructure for developing RESTful services with documentation support using Swagger</li>
<li>Token-based authentication via JWT, including user roles </li>
<li>Dependency injection infrastructure using the Dig framework </li>
<li>Support for connecting to four powerful databases: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and Neo4J, using the Repository Pattern </li>
<li>Multilingual error management and message generation system </li>
<li>Other foundational features such as Jalali and Gregorian date management, list handling, and more.</li>
</ul>
The project structure is based on Clean Architecture and follows the hierarchy shown below. <br><br>
